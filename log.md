# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Wrote about my problem with starting out, set up this repository

**Thoughts:** Wow, it took me a lot of time to write just the one page. I need to practise this kind of writing more, but it is fun, which is a good point for improving on it.

### Day 1: April 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time planning for the app. Created a repository for it and one for the backend as well. I scaffolded the NestJS Backend.

**Thoughts:** I need to brush up my Markdown Knowledge, so for now I'm using this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). As much as I enjoyed planning and thinking about the app, I'm looking forward to actually code something.

### Day 2: April 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I began working with the backend. Made not much progress, because I got lost trying to figure out how to not commit the connection data to the mongo db.

**Thoughts:** I never worked with a public repository, so I need to keep in mind not to accidently leak some information like the database connection data.
