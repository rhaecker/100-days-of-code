# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Wrote about my problem with starting out, set up this repository

**Thoughts:** Wow, it took me a lot of time to write just the one page. I need to practise this kind of writing more, but it is fun, which is a good point for improving on it.

### Day 1: April 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time planning for the app. Created a repository for it and one for the backend as well. I scaffolded the NestJS Backend.

**Thoughts:** I need to brush up my Markdown Knowledge, so for now I'm using this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). As much as I enjoyed planning and thinking about the app, I'm looking forward to actually code something.

### Day 2: April 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I began working with the backend. Made not much progress, because I got lost trying to figure out how to not commit the connection data to the mongo db.

**Thoughts:** I never worked with a public repository, so I need to keep in mind not to accidently leak some information like the database connection data.

### Day 3: April 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I worked on different configuration options and als started writing something about it.

**Thoughts:** Testing stuff and writing about it, takes me a lot of time, I think I need to improve my workflow here.

**Link to work:** sadly nothing. It took me longer than expected, so I have nothing that I could commit or upload yet.

### Day 4: May 01, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I wrote a lengthy piece, just to realize, I need to learn to read. Will decide tomorrow if I publish it anyway.

**Thoughts:** I'm still slow at writing. Maybe I can spend tomorrow looking for tips on it. Also I didn't manage to code on friday, so I spend some more time today.

**Link to work:** sadly nothing. It took me longer than expected, so I have nothing that I could commit or upload yet.

### Day 5: May 03, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finally added the database configuration from the .env file. I managed to do it in a way, so I can configure multiple databases from there.

**Thoughts:** Wow, I suck at this. I skipped 2 days within the first week, which would technically make me fail this callenge already.

### Day 6: May 04, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished a short write up of my adventures with configuring the database. It contains mostly the results.

**Thoughts:** Not much. Forgot to write the log and commit.

### Day 7: May 06, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the story about me and the database config. Also started adding CRUD functionality for Hosts of Buzzz.

**Thoughts:** The CLI of Nest ist cool. Takes away a lot of work with creating the basic structures of the modules.
