# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Wrote about my problem with starting out, set up this repository

**Thoughts:** Wow, it took me a lot of time to write just the one page. I need to practise this kind of writing more, but it is fun, which is a good point for improving on it.

**Link to work:** [dev.to post about starting](https://dev.to/raphael_haecker/my-problem-with-starting-out-4a7b)
